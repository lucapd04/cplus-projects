# cplus-projects
A compilation of some of my C++ projects:

The Birthday project analyzes a string containing the user's birthday and formats it correctly, telling the day, month and year of their birthday. The program checks first if the user's birthday is a valid birthday as per the conditional statements, printing different error clauses depending on which conditions the user input breaches. Otherwise, if the input passes all the conditions the output is printed in the right format.

The pointer project uses pointers to collect different names to store in an array, which is then printed out as an organized list.

The guessing game project uses loops to create a continuous guessing game which only stops until the user says so, breaking the while loop.

Assignment3 uses the different functions to modify a string inputed by the user. The changes are also made as according to the user's input.

The structure project generates a list of countries, however these lists are all generated using only a single array which is modified as the program runs.
